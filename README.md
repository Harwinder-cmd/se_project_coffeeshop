This is the second project of the Software Engineer program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

This website lays down a great foundation for use in different industries and scenarios. Many of the blocks are reusable elsewhere without changing most of their functions. Like the form block, which you can take and implement into another project to obtain required user info.
